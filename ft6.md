## Low-Cost 6-Axis Force/Torque Sensor 

**Project description:** <br/>
Force/Torque sensors are useful in a variety of applications, especially robot manipulation. Most of these sensors are fragile and extremely expensive. Our goal is to develop a low-cost, copact -axis sensor that we can easily integrate into a robot hand.

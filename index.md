## About Me

Hello! My name is Sharfin and I am a fourth year doctoral student at Columbia University. I am advised by Matei Ciocarlie and work on mechanical design of robotic manipulators. Before my PhD, I worked on design of minimally actuated quasi-passive walkers with Aaron Johnson, Sarah Bergbreiter, and Justin Yim.
<br><br/>
Overall, I am interested in clever, but simple mechanical designs that can be easily controlled and deployed in real robotic applications.

## Projects

[Low-Cost 6-Axis Force/Torque Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03481)<br/>
A novel method for six-axis force/torque sensing that allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, and easy integration into a complete hand.

[Hardware/Software Co-Optimization](https://roamlab.github.io/tentamorph/)<br/>
We first formulate a general model for an underactuated, tendon-driven transmission and then use this model to co-optimize a three-link, two-actuator kinematic chain using reinforcement learning.

[Minimally Actuated Quasi-Passive Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kECAdJEaJlk)<br/>
By leveraging the passive 3D dynamics, carefully designing the spherical feet, and changing the actuation scheme, we are able to produce a very simple 3D bipedal walking model that has a total of 5 rigid bodies and a single actuator per leg.

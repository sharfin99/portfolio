## About Me

Hello! My name is Sharfin and I am a fourth year doctoral student at Columbia University. I am advised by Matei Ciocarlie and work on mechanical design of robotic manipulators. Before my PhD, I worked on design of minimally actuated quasi-passive walkers.
<br><br/>
Overall, I am interested in clever, but simple mechanical designs that can be easily controlled and deployed in real robotic applications.

## About Me

Hello! My name is Sharfin and I am a fourth year doctoral student at Columbia University. I am advised by Matei Ciocarlie and work on mechanical design of robotic manipulators. Previously in my undergrad, I worked on design of minimally actuated quasi-passive walkers. Overall, I am interested in clever, but simple mechanical designs that can be easily controlled and deployed in real robotic applications. 
<br><br/>
Building real robots requires both the hardware and software to work in harmony. I bring extensive hardware design experience, but also a strong foundation in computational modelling and optimization tools for controlling real robots.

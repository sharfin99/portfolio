**Project description:** <br/>
Determining an appropriate set of hardware parameters for underactuated transmissions is difficult - even for traditional taskbased co-optimization methods. In this paper, our goal is to implement a task-based design and policy co-optimization method for underactuated, tendon-driven trasnmissions.
